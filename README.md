# Serve (Java HTTP Server)

This is a very simple server written in Java.  The plan is to add a lisp-like templating language which can be served, but that will take time.  The point of this is mostly to learn the inner workings and requirements of a server/web framework, but I also hope that this is actually useful someday.
